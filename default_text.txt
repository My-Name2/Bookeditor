Audrey

I wake up to sunlight directly in my face, which feels unnecessary.

I’m almost positive I closed the curtains last night. I remember doing it with intention. But Nadia likes to open every curtain in the apartment before she leaves for work, as if she’s personally responsible for providing the building with vitamin D.

Unfortunately, my bed is right next to the smallest window. The one that hits you at full force.

I pull the blanket over my head and consider pretending I still have a job.

When I did have one, waking up early wasn’t optional. Now it’s just rude.

I check my phone.

10:41 a.m.

Two weeks ago I would’ve already been halfway through a shift, balancing three coffee refills and an old man asking why we don’t serve real maple syrup anymore.

Now I just lie there thinking about rent.

I share a bedroom with Nadia. Three other girls share the rest of the apartment. Five of us in total. We don’t really have anything in common except financial instability and a mutual understanding that if one of us moves out, the rest of us are screwed.

New York rent is not for the weak.

I finally drag myself out of bed and go brush my teeth, avoiding eye contact with myself in the mirror like I owe me money.

The kitchen is basically decorative, but it has a stove, so technically it counts. I make scrambled eggs because they’re cheap and because I can’t emotionally handle a complicated breakfast right now.

And yes, I put ketchup on them.

I don’t need commentary on that.

I’m halfway through my extremely gourmet meal when my phone buzzes. It’s the diner group chat.

I hesitate before opening it.

A month ago, the owner handed the diner over to his son. The original owner was genuinely kind. The type of man who slipped you extra cash around the holidays and remembered regulars’ grandkids’ names.

His son is a forty-year-old former car salesman who somehow decided restaurants would be a fun side quest.

He started changing everything immediately. The menu. The prices. The schedules. He micromanaged like we were performing surgery instead of serving pancakes. Regular customers stopped coming in. The atmosphere shifted.

And then there was the staring.

The kind that lingers too long.

The kind that makes you hyper aware of your uniform.

After two weeks, I quit. No backup plan. No dramatic speech. I just untied my apron, handed it over, and walked out before I could talk myself into staying.

I had savings. A few thousand dollars. Emergency money.

Apparently, I am the emergency.

I open the chat.

Two more waitresses are complaining. Someone says they’re thinking of quitting. I feel a brief flicker of guilt. Then relief.

I close it and switch to the group chat that matters.

Lily. June. Me.

We’ve been friends since high school. Lily works in a corporate office. June just had a baby and somehow still has time to text us.

I type:

Me: how does one apply to be a naked cleaner for rich men

June replies immediately.

June: It’s been two weeks.

Me: I’ve spent 40% of my savings.

Which might be an exaggeration. But only slightly.

Lily: Have you applied anywhere else?

Me: like 20 places. diners. restaurants. cafes. nothing.

There’s a pause.

Lily: Well…

I stare at that word. I don’t like “well.”

Me: what.

June: 👀

Lily: How do you feel about being extremely stressed, having a lot of responsibility, and dealing with a literal child?

I blink at my screen.

June: I didn’t post a job listing.

Lily: Not you.

Me: define “dealing with a child.”

Lily: My boss is the child.

I sit up a little straighter.

Me: is he insane

Lily: He’s intense.

Me: that’s corporate code for insane.

Lily: He pays very well.

There it is.

I look around the apartment. The chipped cabinets. The ancient fridge that hums like it’s on life support. My bank balance floating in my head like a countdown clock.

Me: how well?

My phone buzzes again almost immediately.

And just like that, I get the feeling my life is about to become way more complicated.
Chapter Two

Shawn

This meeting should’ve been an email.

I sit at the head of the conference table while a new hire from operations gestures aggressively at a slideshow like he’s pitching the cure for boredom.

Unfortunately, he is the boredom.

If this wasn’t an important client, I would’ve already faked a phone call and walked out. I’ve done it before. I’m not above it.

He keeps talking. Something about projected growth and “dynamic restructuring.”

I give him a look.

Not even a full glare. Just enough.

He immediately loses momentum. His hands stop moving. His voice drops a notch. Good.

I’m not usually this impatient. Or maybe I am. The last few weeks have just been worse than usual. We’ve had internal changes, which somehow means more work for me. Always more work for me.

And I fired my assistant.

Again.

Lydia, who has worked here longer than I’ve technically been an adult, told me I need to “chill out.” Her words, not mine. She claims it’s impossible for someone to meet my standards and remain psychologically stable.

I disagree.

I just haven’t found the right one yet.

I made an announcement to the staff last week. If anyone knew someone capable enough to survive working directly under me, send them my way. I’d handle the interviews personally. I don’t trust HR with something this important.

My stomach growls, and I glance at the time.

Past two.

I’ve had coffee. That’s it.

If I don’t eat, I’ll get a migraine. If I get a migraine, everyone in this building will suffer for it.

I discreetly open my phone under the table and order grilled chicken and rice from the place downstairs. Efficient. Predictable. Delivered in ten minutes.

The meeting finally ends. I stand up before anyone can try to make small talk.

Back in my office, I eat at my desk. Three bites in, there’s a knock.

I consider ignoring it.

But I’m not completely unreasonable.

“Come in.”

The door opens, and the redhead from marketing steps inside. Lily. That’s her name.

Her eyes widen slightly when she sees the food.

“I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t realize you were having lunch. I can come back.”

“But you’re already here,” I say flatly.

She hesitates, then nods. “Right. Yes.”

I take another bite. “So?”

Her posture straightens. “I have a candidate for your personal assistant position.”

That gets my attention.

She walks forward and places a printed resume on my desk like she’s presenting evidence in court.

I glance at it.

Audrey Jones.

I skim.

Diner waitress. Tutor. No corporate experience.

I look up. “She’s never worked in an office.”

“I know,” Lily says quickly. “But I know her personally. She’s smart. She works well under pressure. She’s organized even when things are chaotic. And she’s not intimidated easily.”

That last part almost makes me smile.

Almost.

I lean back in my chair. “You understand this isn’t a casual position.”

“Yes, sir.”

“She’ll be managing my calendar. My travel. My meetings. My personal obligations.”

“I know.”

“She’ll need to anticipate what I need before I ask.”

Lily nods like she’s rehearsed this.

There’s something about the way she’s looking at me. Not scared. Not exactly. Just… hopeful.

I sigh.

“Tomorrow. Two p.m.”

Her face lights up instantly. “Thank you, sir. I promise you won’t regret it.”

We’ll see.


---

I get home close to ten.

The penthouse is spotless. It always is. I have a cleaning service that comes three times a week. It’s excessive considering I’m barely here, but I like things controlled.

Quiet.

There’s no one waiting when I walk in. No noise. No distraction.

I could get a dog. My mother suggests it every few months. But I don’t have time. It would be irresponsible.

I don’t like being irresponsible.

Growing up, I had enough of that.

My biological parents weren’t cruel. Just careless. Careless enough that I ended up in the foster system at thirteen. I remember being terrified when the Roberts adopted me. I’d heard enough stories to expect the worst.

Instead, they were patient. Kind. Stable.

After my father passed, I took over the company. I’d already been working with him, managing finances and operations. It wasn’t impossible. Just heavy.

It still is.

I shower, change, and collapse into bed. I call my mom before sleeping.

She answers on the second ring.

“How was your day?”

“Productive,” I say.

“Stressful?”

“That too.”

She laughs softly. “David Cooper is getting married next month.”

I didn’t know that.

“I didn’t get an invitation.”

“They haven’t sent them yet. You will.”

We talk for a few more minutes. She asks if I’m eating properly. I lie and say yes.

Sleep comes quickly.


---

The next morning, I arrive at the office later than usual. On purpose.

My calendar is stacked with interviews after lunch.

I skim emails while finishing my coffee. One catches my eye.

Diana.

My former assistant.

The email is passive aggressive. She implies I fired her without reason. That I misunderstood her “friendly personality.”

I close it.

Diana was efficient. Until she wasn’t. She blurred lines that I don’t allow blurred. When I addressed it, she insisted it was in my head.

It wasn’t.

I don’t mix business with anything else. Ever.

At one p.m., I tell HR to send in the candidates one by one.

The first is a business school graduate who thinks confidence is the same thing as competence.

The second talks too much.

The third barely talks at all.

By the fourth, I’m irritated.

HR buzzes again. “Next candidate is Audrey Jones.”

Right. Lily’s friend.

“Send her in.”

The door opens.

She walks in, and for half a second, I forget what I was about to say.

Dark hair. Soft curls. Big eyes. Slightly flushed cheeks like she rushed here.

She’s wearing a simple dress. Professional. Not flashy. It fits her well.

I force my expression into neutral.

“Audrey Jones?”

“Yes,” she says.

She sounds a little out of breath.

“Have a seat.”

She sits, glancing briefly around my office. Most people are impressed by the size. She looks… cautious.

I study her for a moment longer than necessary.

“Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interv—”

“We don’t need to make this formal,” I cut in. “If you’re hired, your role won’t be like everyone else’s.”

“I understand.”

Her voice is steadier now.

“Why does Lily think you’re right for this?”

She straightens slightly. “She’s seen me work under pressure. I handled a busy diner for years. I can multitask. I’m organized. And I don’t fall apart when things get chaotic.”

I watch her carefully.

“Don’t try to seduce me.”

Her eyes widen. “Excuse me?”

“That’s why I fired my last assistant.”

She stares at me for a second, clearly trying to decide if I’m serious.

“I can promise you,” she says finally, “there will be absolutely no seduction from my side.”

There’s something in her tone. Dry. Slightly offended.

Good.

I nod once.

“You’ll manage every minute of my schedule. I shouldn’t have to think about my calendar. You’ll handle travel arrangements, meals, meetings, family events.”

“Understood.”

“You’ll travel with me.”

“How often?”

“At least once a month.”

She hesitates just a fraction. “Okay.”

I lean back. “You won’t get normal hours.”

“I didn’t expect them.”

That answer surprises me.

We hold eye contact for a moment longer than necessary.

“I’ll let you know,” I say finally.

“Thank you, Mr. Robert.”

She stands and walks out.

I watch her go.

I shouldn’t.

I interview four more candidates, but none of them stay in my head.

She does.

Later that night, I sit on my couch, staring at nothing.

I shouldn’t hire her. Attraction complicates things.

But she didn’t seem intimidated. She didn’t flirt. She didn’t oversell herself.

Before I can overthink it, I open my laptop and send HR a short email.

Offer the position to Audrey Jones.

I close the laptop immediately after.

Decision made.

I’ll deal with the consequences later.
Chapter 3

My phone buzzed on the nightstand.

I almost didn’t pick it up. I assumed it was Lily sending another random meme. But something told me to check.

It was an email.

My stomach tightened.

I opened it.

> Dear Audrey,
We are pleased to inform you that your application has been successful. Your start date is next Monday…



I stared at the screen.

Then it hit me.

“I got it—!”

I jumped off the bed so fast I knocked the mug off the nightstand. It crashed onto the floor and shattered.

“Oh my God—” I gasped, staring at it for half a second.

And then I started laughing.

I couldn’t help it. I got the job. I actually got the job.

Nadia looked up from her laptop. “What are you doing?”

“Nothing,” I said quickly, kneeling down to pick up the pieces. “I’m just clumsy.”

She narrowed her eyes at me but didn’t ask more.

I grabbed my phone and typed into the group chat.

> I GOT THE JOB.
The replies came immediately.

Lily: WHAT
June: I KNEW IT
Lily: WE’RE GOING OUT

By evening we were at a small restaurant we always go to when something big happens.

Lily slid into the booth dramatically. “So. Tell us everything.”

“There’s nothing to tell yet,” I said, smiling. “I start Monday.”

June reached across the table and squeezed my hand. “You deserve this.”

I felt that. I really did.

We talked for hours. About work. About how I’d finally have steady income. About maybe moving somewhere better someday.

I didn’t mention Nadia.

I didn’t want to ruin the mood.


---

Monday came too fast.

I stood in front of the mirror longer than usual. Not because I didn’t know what to wear. Because I didn’t want to look nervous.

I chose something simple. Professional. Nothing that screamed “trying too hard.”

The office was already busy when I arrived.

Phones ringing. People walking quickly. Conversations half-finished.

Shawn’s office was glass-walled. You could see everything inside.

He was already there.

Brown hair slightly messy. Sleeves rolled up. Looking at his laptop like the rest of the world didn’t exist.

I knocked lightly.

He looked up.

Light brown eyes. Steady. Focused.

“Yes?”

“Good morning,” I said.

He studied me for half a second, then gave a small nod. “Morning.”

That nod shouldn’t have mattered.

It did.

I sat at my desk outside his office and started sorting emails immediately. Flagging what mattered. Ignoring what didn’t. Rearranging his morning schedule because two meetings overlapped.

Ten minutes later he stepped out.

“You adjusted the 10:30,” he said.

“Yes. The client pushed it to eleven.”

He paused.

“Good.”

Just one word.

But something about the way he said it made my chest tighten.


---

Late morning, there was a meet-and-greet with the rest of the team.

That’s when I noticed her.

Tall. Sharp suit. Hair perfectly straight. Confident in a way that felt intentional.

“Hi,” she said, looking me up and down briefly. “You must be the new assistant.”

“Yes.”

“I’m Vanessa. I handle client relations.”

Her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

She turned slightly toward Shawn. “You didn’t tell me she was starting today.”

Shawn glanced at her. “It was on the calendar.”

Her lips pressed together for half a second.

“Oh. Right.”

She looked back at me. “It’s… a lot here. Hope you can keep up.”

There it was.

Polite. But not.

“I will,” I said calmly.

Shawn’s eyes shifted between us.

Then he said, evenly, “Audrey already reorganized my morning. She’s keeping up.”

Vanessa’s expression changed slightly.

“Impressive,” she said.

But it didn’t sound impressed.


---

Lunch surprised me.

“I’ll have it brought here,” Shawn said casually. “You’ll eat with me. Easier to go over the afternoon schedule.”

“Oh. Okay.”

I tried to act normal sitting across from him.

He reviewed documents while eating. Focused. Efficient.

At one point he looked up and caught me looking at him.

Not intentionally.

Just observing.

His eyebrow lifted slightly.

“Is there something I missed?”

“No,” I said quickly, looking down at my plate. “Everything’s covered.”

“Good.”

There was the faintest hint of a smile before he looked back at his papers.

My heart thumped harder than it should have.


---

The afternoon was nonstop.

At one point Vanessa walked into his office without knocking.

“Shawn, about the Henderson account—”

She stopped when she saw me sitting there.

“Oh.”

Shawn didn’t look up immediately. “Yes?”

“I didn’t realize you were… in the middle of something.”

“We’re reviewing schedules.”

She hesitated.

“I can wait,” I said, standing up.

Shawn’s eyes flicked to me. “You don’t need to.”

Vanessa noticed that.

“I’ll come back,” she said, a little too quickly.

After she left, there was a brief silence.

“She’s been here a while,” I said carefully.

“Yes.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s it,” he replied.

Something about that made me feel better than it should have.


---

That evening when I got home, Nadia was waiting.

“You’ve been secretive,” she said.

“I’ve just been busy.”

“With what?”

“I got a job,” I said finally.

Her expression changed.

“Where?”

“I start this week.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

I hesitated.

She crossed her arms. “You didn’t even tell me you were applying.”

“I didn’t want to jinx it.”

The air felt heavy after that.

I went to my room without saying more.


---

That night, lying in bed, I replayed everything.

The email.

The restaurant.

Vanessa’s smile.

Shawn saying, “She’s keeping up.”

The way his light brown eyes held mine for that extra second at lunch.

I told myself it didn’t mean anything.

It probably didn’t.

Still, when I closed my eyes, I saw that small almost-smile again.

And my heart did that annoying thing where it sped up for no practical reason.
Chapter 4

Two weeks into my new job, and my apartment already feels smaller.

Not physically. The walls are still the same dull shade of exhausted beige. The couch still sinks in the middle. But the air feels tight. Like it’s watching me.

Nadia started changing after the first week.

It began subtly. My groceries shifting places. Her music playing just a little louder when I had early mornings. Dishes stacking up in the sink on the exact nights I got home late.

Then came the comments.

“Must be nice,” she muttered once, watching me answer a work call.
“Some people just get lucky.”

Lucky.

As if I hadn’t clawed my way through interviews and sleepless nights.

The worst was the phone call.

I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop. Her voice just carried.

“She just started and she already acts busy. Assistants can make serious money if they play it right. Watch her. She’ll be rich in a year. It’s not like she’s even that qualified.”

I stood in my room, staring at my closed door.

There’s something surreal about hearing someone reduce you to a narrative they invented.

That was the night I started thinking about leaving.

By the next afternoon, I was venting in the group chat during lunch break.

> Me: I swear she hates that I got this job.
Me: I haven’t even gotten paid yet.



June sent a voicemail.

I didn’t check where I was before pressing play.

Her voice exploded into the office.

“Audrey, oh my God, you need to get out of there. If I had the spare bedroom, I’d let you move in immediately, but my cousin is staying with us right now. You cannot stay in that apartment.”

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Slowly, I looked up.

I share an office with my boss.

With Shawn.

He was seated across from me, reviewing something on his tablet. Brown hair slightly messy, sleeves rolled up just enough to show his watch. Controlled. Polished. Hot.

He lifted his gaze.

Light brown eyes.

Not dark. Not soft either. Sharp, almost golden under the office lighting.

They met mine.

And held.

My heart did something inconvenient.

“I’m sorry,” I said quickly, fumbling to lower the volume.

“It’s fine,” he replied.

His voice was calm and neutral. But I could tell he’d heard every word.

He didn’t bring it up for the rest of the day.

Which somehow made it worse.
At six-thirty, as I was packing my bag—

“Audrey.”

I froze.

I turned around. “Yes? Is there anything else you need before I leave?”

He leaned back in his chair, studying me. Not in a rushed way.

Just… observing.

“Do you need a place to move?”

My mind blanked.

“I— it’s nothing. I’ll figure it out.”

“It didn’t sound like nothing.”

His eyes didn’t leave mine.

And there it was again. That steady gaze that made it difficult to breathe normally.

“It’s not your .."

“..Business. I know.”

He stood.

When Shawn moves, it’s deliberate. No wasted motion. He walked around his desk and stopped a few feet away from me. Close enough that I could see the faint flecks of amber in his eyes.

“I have three extra rooms,” he said. “My penthouse is too large for one person. If you were interested in assisting with household management as well, it would make sense.”

“Household management,” I repeated, because my brain needed something to hold onto.

“I travel often. My schedule is demanding. I need management for people I hire for housework, delivery people etc. I could use someone I trust.”

Trust.

My pulse skipped.

“I would increase your salary by five thousand a month.”

Five thousand.

My heart began thumping so loudly I was convinced he could hear it.

“I’m not asking for an answer now,” he added. There was the faintest curve at the corner of his mouth. Not a full smile. Just the suggestion of one. “Think about it.”

I nodded.

“Take your time.”

His gaze lingered a second too long before he stepped back.

“You’re dismissed.”

I walked out of that office like gravity had changed.


---

That night, Nadia and I finally clashed.

She accused me of “acting different.”

I told her I was tired.

She asked who would cover the lease if I left, like she already sensed it.

I didn’t answer.

Later, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling crack that looks like a fractured map, I replayed Shawn’s expression.

The way he’d said trust.

The way his eyes had softened just slightly when he told me to take my time.

This is a terrible idea, I told myself.

I picked up my phone anyway.

> Me: If I were to consider it… what would it imply exactly?



The reply came quickly.

> Shawn: Relax. I’m not asking for anything inappropriate.



Heat rushed to my face.

> Me: I figured.


> Shawn: We would mostly see each other at work. I sleep early. The space is large. You’d have privacy.


> Shawn: It would simply be practical.



My heart was still beating too fast for something “practical.”

I stared at the message.

And then—

> Me: Okay.



I sent it before I could rethink it.


---

A week later, I was carrying boxes down the hallway of the apartment.

I paid the emergency move-out fee myself. Watching my savings shrink hurt, but staying would’ve cost more.

Nadia stood in the doorway as I taped my final box.

“You’re really leaving?”

“Yes.”

“Who’s covering the penalty?”

“I did.”

“With what money?”

“My own.”

Her expression shifted. “Where are you going?”

I lifted the box. “I don’t owe you that.”

Her silence followed me all the way to the elevator.


---

Shawn’s penthouse sits above the city like it owns it.

The elevator ride up felt surreal. When the doors opened, I stepped into glass and marble and quiet.

Floor-to-ceiling windows. A skyline stretched out like spilled diamonds. Everything perfectly arranged.

It didn’t feel lived in.

It felt curated.

Shawn stood near the windows, sunlight catching in his brown hair.

“Welcome.”

I swallowed. “It’s… beautiful.”

He watched my reaction carefully. Almost analytically. Like he was measuring something.

“These are the two available rooms,” he said, guiding me down the hallway. “The third is my study.”

I nodded, trying not to notice how close he was walking beside me.

The first room was bright and cool.

The second—

I stepped inside.

Warmer lighting. Larger closet.

And then I realized.

It was right next to his bedroom.

I paused.

He noticed.

“That one has better soundproofing,” he said calmly.

Of course it does.

I turned to face him.

He was leaning slightly against the doorway now, arms loosely crossed. His light brown eyes steady on me.

There it was again. That almost-smile.

Not teasing.

But aware.

My heart began its traitorous rhythm.

“I’ll take this one,” I said.

His gaze sharpened slightly. Just for a second.

“Very well.”

He stepped inside to help me with a box. When he set it down, our fingers brushed.

It was brief.

But intentional enough that neither of us pretended it didn’t happen.

We were standing too close in the middle of the room now.

“This arrangement remains professional,” he said quietly.

His eyes held mine.

Professional.

“Of course,” I replied.

My voice sounded steadier than I felt.

“If at any point you’re uncomfortable, you tell me.”

Something about the way he said it made my chest tighten.

“I will.”

He nodded once, then stepped back.

“Dinner is at ten. You’re welcome to join.”

A pause.

“Or not.”

The corner of his mouth lifted again.

I exhaled slowly after he left.

The door to his room was only a few steps away.

Too close.

I walked to the window instead and looked out over the city. Everything glittered below, distant and untouchable.

Behind one of these walls was my boss. My very handsome boss mind you. Who's also my landlord now.

This is practical, I told myself.

Completely practical.

At exactly ten, there was a soft knock at my door.

My heart leapt before I could stop it.

I crossed the room and opened it.

Shawn stood there, sleeves rolled up again, a subtle glimmer in his eyes.

“Ready?”

And just like that, the line shifted a fraction.

Not crossed.

Just… thinner.
Chapter 5 – Shawn

It had been three days since Audrey had been here, and somehow, life was easier.

Not in some huge, dramatic way. Just… smoother.

Food showed up on time because she handled the deliveries. Coffee appeared when I needed it. My calendar made sense for once. Meetings weren’t stacked on top of each other because I double booked like an idiot. Mail was sorted before it could pile up.

She took care of everything quietly, like it was nothing.

I hadn’t realized how chaotic things had been before she moved in. How normal it had felt to forget things. To skip meals. To live in constant noise.

Now there was order.

She made my life easier at both work and home. And it hasn't even been a month of her working for me.

The strange part was, she still acted like she didn’t belong here.

She moved carefully sometimes, like she was afraid of taking up too much space. She’d hesitate before sitting down, like she was reminding herself this wasn’t really her home. She’d thank me for small things she didn’t need to thank me for. Like I was doing her some huge favor just by letting her stay.

She wasn’t.

If anything, she’d made my life easier in three days than anyone had in years.

I found myself doing small things without thinking. Like ordering a family pack of a snack I saw her eat in the office at lunch break.

But this doesn't mean anything. She's my employee and I'm supposed to care about her, right?

She was sitting on the couch now, her legs tucked to one side, phone in her hand while she checked something on my schedule. Her curls fell loosely around her face, soft and dark, catching the light when she moved. Every now and then she’d tuck a piece behind her ear, focused on whatever she was doing.

Her eyes were darker than I remembered. Black, almost. Quiet, but sharp. She has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.
She looked comfortable.

And that did something to me.

She was wearing simple shorts and an oversized shirt, nothing special, but it didn’t matter. Her legs stretched out when she shifted slightly, relaxed, unaware of the effect it had on me. Or a certain body part where all my blood was rushing towards.

I shouldn’t have been noticing.

But I did.

Like she could feel it, she glanced up suddenly.

Our eyes met.

And there it was.

That immediate change in her expression. Her cheeks turning pink. Her eyes widening just slightly before she looked away again, pretending to focus on her phone.

She didn’t say anything.

Neither did I.

The room stayed quiet, but it wasn’t the same kind of quiet as before.


In the shower that night, I caught myself imagining her there instead. Leaning under the spray, hair wet, black curls plastered against her skin. My hand itched to… no. Stop. Stop.

But I didn’t stop. Not at first.

The hot water sluiced over my shoulders, steam fogging the glass. I let my head fall back, and there she was, painted on the backs of my eyelids. Audrey. Naked. Her skin glistening, water tracing the valley between her breasts, beading on her nipples. A fantasy so vivid I could almost smell her—clean soap and something uniquely her.

My cock, already half-hard from the thought of her in the living room, thickened against my stomach. A low groan escaped me, swallowed by the shower’s roar. My hand drifted down, fingers wrapping around my shaft. It was hot and heavy in my palm, a throbbing, insistent weight. I began to stroke, slowly at first, a slick glide under the water.

I pictured her turning toward me in the steam, her eyes heavy-lidded, knowing. Her hand replacing mine, her slender fingers tightening.

“What can I do for you Shawn?” her phantom voice whispered.

My strokes grew faster, my fist pumping my cock with a rhythm that matched the frantic beat of my heart. Pre-cum leaked from the slit, mixing with the shower spray, making the slide wet and filthy.

I imagined her dropping to her knees right there on the wet tile, her mouth opening, her tongue licking that drop away before taking me deep.
My breath came in ragged gasps. My hips began to jerk, fucking into my own fist. I was close, so close, the pressure coiling at the base of my spine. I could see it—my release painting her face, her tongue darting out to catch it. The forbidden, professional line vaporizing in the steam.

Stop. Stop.

The word was a crack of lightning in the fog of lust. She was my assistant. My employee. Boundaries.

With a shudder that was pure agony, I ripped my hand away from my aching cock. It stood out, angry and red, throbbing with denied release.

I braced both hands against the cool tile, hanging my head, letting the water punish my back. I turned the knob to the coldest setting. The fantasy shattered, leaving me hollow and tense. The slow burn in my chest wasn’t just refusal—it was a banked fire, waiting for a single breath to roar back to life.

I forced my eyes shut and shook my head, trying to reclaim the part of me that still thought like a professional. My chest tightened anyway, a slow burn that refused to die.



The next day, I found her at her car, jiggling the keys and muttering to herself. That old thing wouldn’t start, and she looked annoyed, frustrated, like she didn’t know whether to laugh or swear.

I let out a sigh.

“Get in my car,” I said.

She blinked at me. “I… I can manage.”

“Nope. Get in my car.”

She froze for a second, then rolled her eyes and got in. Didn’t say a word. Just sat there, tucking her hair behind her ear, hands on her lap. I drove, trying not to look too much, failing anyway.

At the office, Vanessa spotted us immediately. Her smirk was annoying.

“Well, well,” she said, loud enough that I could hear it clear. “Already moved in with Mr. Roberts?”
Audrey’s jaw tightened. “I’m his full-time assistant,” she said. “I live here because it’s practical. That’s it.”

Vanessa just smirked and muttered something under her breath before walking away. Audrey’s shoulders dipped for half a second, then she was back at her work, ignoring everyone.

I watched.

My hands were tight on my coffee mug.

Later, I called Vanessa into my office.
She came in confident, smirking. I didn’t even bother with pleasantries.

“Vanessa,” I said, flat. “I don’t tolerate gossip here. Ask me if you need something. Otherwise—”

“Yes, Mr. Roberts,” she stammered. Her face went from confident to ashy in a second.

“Good. You’re dismissed.”

She left. The office felt quieter immediately.
I turned back to Audrey. She was hunched over her paperwork, hair messy. Does she have any idea how attractive she is?

I wanted to tell her something, anything, but all I could do was watch. She looked up for a split second, caught me staring, then went back to work. My chest tightened.
That was it. No words. No dramatic look.

Just her.

And me noticing her. Again.
